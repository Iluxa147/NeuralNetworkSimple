# NeuralNetworkSimple
Simple neural nw representation
Network kernel (main classes structure and computation) is based on tutorial by David Miller https://vimeo.com/19569529

## Any topology. Train data generation to .txt

## Bool operations
can be trained to compute any bool operations with about e-5 error

## Two-digit unsigned maths
can be trained to complete any maths tasks with non-negative numbers with answer range [0; 100]

## Serealization / Deserialization
best trained network structure is written to file with rapidjson lib http://rapidjson.org/index.html

## Multithreading training
for net crossover purposes

## Crossover WIP
WIP crossover generations for training speedup

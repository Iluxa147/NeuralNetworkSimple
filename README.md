# NeuralNetworkSimple
Simple neural nw representation

Network kernel (main classes structure and computation) is based on tutorial by David Miller https://vimeo.com/19569529


# Serealization / Deserialization
network structure is written to file with rapidjson lib http://rapidjson.org/index.html

# Multithreading training
for net crossover purposes

# Crossover WIP
WIP crossover generations for training speedup
